            <p>
                Obviously, I am a voucher for online safety. So please don't send me a virus. Haha. But seriously, I take 
                all sorts of emails, including those regarding jobs, questions, complaints, comments, and all sorts of
                things. When sending an email to me, please include the following things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Name. This can be made up, I don't care. I just want something to call you. It could even be something
                    like "that guy who needs help", or "extemely good coder girl". Just give me a name! Haha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Subject. This could be a title to your complaint, the question, a title to a comment, a bug name, you
                    name it(haha, get it?). Just something I can write down in the log to keep for the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Description. If it's a bug, describe it precisely. If it's a problem, ditto. I can't do anything if 
                    I don't understand the problem/bug. If it's a comment, thats where this would go(obviously).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contact Information. If you're emailing me, I probably have your email. So that it pretty much covered.
                    Sadly, I don't support phone calls, or texts. Sorry. However, I have almost untapped contact to my 
                    email, so yep.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Specifications. If you are hiring me to do some work, we can talk a little about that, but I need to
                    know the specifications of the site or work you're asking me to make. This means what you want from 
                    me, how you want the design to work, the type of work(blog, small project, full website), all of the 
                    facts I need to properly help you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Signature. This isn't necessarily needed, but highly appreciated!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> I don't do explicit content. I also do not break laws. So don't even ask. I follow 
                the rules, and am boring(I know). If you want anything that would go against the above, go somewhere else.
                Thank you.
            </p>
